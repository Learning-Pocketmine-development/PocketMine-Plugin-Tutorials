				Well, I guess, this is the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> version of PocketMine plugin tutorials from
				me?<br>
				I must admit that the versions before had not been very successful, so I guess we should start all over
				again.<br>
				This time, I created the tutorials with GitHub sites. Hopefully more customizable pages will help make
				the tutorials better.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, first of all, let's get to know clearly what we are planning to do.<br>
				<span class="note">Wait, aren't we going to code PocketMine plugins? Isn't that clear enough?</span><br>
				Then what exactly does a PocketMine plugin do? The answer could be quite vague.<br>
				Basically, a plugin has unlimited power (including root access if you are running the server with root)
				on your server. It is the commander of your server. Plugins instruct PocketMine to get everything done.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="note">
					So I know that the plugin is the god. But how does knowing that help me?
				</span><br>
				The problem that made most people unable to code is that most people don't know what they want.<br>
				<span class="note">I know very clearly. I want to make a hunger games plugin.</span><br>
				But then, what is a hunger games plugin?<br>

				The outline for a hunger games plugin actually shows three of the most important components of plugins:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Commands</li>
				<li>Events (when something happens)</li>
				<li>Timer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Of course, we are nowhere near the complexity of a good hunger games plugin. But at least now we know
				better what we are going to do.
			</p>

			<p>
				In Chapters 3-5 of this website, we will go through the principles of these three
				components, as well as some fundamental ways of doing various actions on the server.<br>
				But before that, we would start by creating <em>a useless plugin that works</em>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="tree" data-name="Chapter 1 - A useless plugin that works: No code yet, no trouble yet">
			<div class="tree" data-name="Basic tools">
				It is hilarious for many times someone asks me to teach him/her plugin development, and after half an
				hour
				long talk of theory we decided to get our hands on getting something produced and realized that he/she
				did
				not have the necessary tools ready. Make sure you have everything in this <em>basic</em> checklist:
				<ul>
					<li>A PocketMine server that you can <em>directly</em> change its plugin files.<br>
						For testing plugins, obviously.
					</li>
					<li>
						A virtual/hard keyboard that can let you type symbols like
						<code class="code">,.;!?$/\|()[]{}</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Yes, that's all. If that's all the resources you got, you could still code plugins, but with very hard
				time.<br>
				Here is a list of <em>recommended</em> tools:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Text editor</strong><br>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Windows</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										If you are thinking about <em>Microsoft Word</em>, get rid of that thought
										immediately. Microsoft Word is a rich text editor, and it simply cannot open nor
										output any text files. Same applies to <em>WordPad</em> that came in Windows'
										<em>Accessories</em>.<br>
									</li>
									<li>
										You may be thinking about <em>NotePad</em> that came in the <em>Accessories</em>
										with Windows. Well, it is the best option if you can't install anything on your
										computer. (But then how did you install PocketMine?)
									</li>
									<li>
										The recommended tool is <em><a
											href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a></em>. It is a powerful
										text editor for many types of files and for different programming languages.
									</li>
									<li>
										Some would recommend NetBeans, but I wouldn't want you to waste time doing all
										the setup stuff. Believe me, setup for a program always makes anything
										interesting into boring.
									</li>
									<li>
										If you have heard of PhpStorm, again, same with NetBeans, setup trouble
										(although there isn't a lot). Moreover, it is paid software, although there are
										some ways to legitimately get it for free. Nevertheless, it is an all-powerful
										IDE that completes the code for you when you have provided a little hint, and
										can also be used for other things like coding websites, etc. Actually, this
										website was written using PhpStorm (although there is no PHP here).
									</li>
									<li><strong>Browser + GitHub</strong>
										The GitHub editor for code is not bad, at least better than Windows Notepad, but
										it is far not as good as PhpStorm. If you don't like installing anything, this
										is a good alternative to Notepad++.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>OS X</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Some would recommend NetBeans, but I wouldn't want you to waste time doing all
										the setup stuff. Believe me, setup for a program always makes anything
										interesting into boring.

									</li>
									<li><strong>TextMate</strong>
										<em><a
											href="http://macromates.com/download">TextMate</a></em> (Use the beta!) is an powerful free Editor,
											with Syntnax highlighing. It has some realy neat functions, and works perfectly with git.
											It is a powerful text editor for many types of files and for different programming languages.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>iOS</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>I have never used iOS, so don't ask me :(</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Android</strong><br>
								I would not advise coding on phones or tablets, but if you don't have an alternative,
								well...
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Normal text editors</strong><br>
										Whatever editor you like, as long as it disables autocorrect. You can try <em>Text
											Editor</em> embedded in the <em>File Manager</em> app.<br>
										BTW, you need a file explorer since plugins consist of more than one file when
										you are developing.
									</li>
									<li><strong>Vim Touch</strong><br>
										It is an imitation of <em>Vim</em> for Linux. It is an odd choice, but it has
										good things if you
									</li>
									<li><strong>Chrome + GitHub</strong>
										Many mobile users found GitHub's direct edit interface good, although it isn't
										at all.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>A browser</strong><br>
						For you to look for documentation (and this website) anytime you have trouble. Believe me,
						nobody memorizes all the functions in PHP.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Yes, this simple. That's all you need. But again, I strongly encourage you to get a computer and a
					hard keyboard, or you can hardly develop anything big without finding all your <code class="code">$this</code>
					becoming <code class="code">$thos</code>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tree" data-name="Setting up plugin manifest">
				<p>
					I would assume that you have PocketMine setup already. I hope I don't need to teach you how to find
					that directory.<br>
					<span class="note">Fine. For Android it is <code class="code">~/PocketMine</code>, where <code
							class="code">~</code> is something
						like <code class="code">/mnt/sdcard</code>, etc.</span><br>
					Navigate to the <code class="code">plugins</code> directory (a.k.a. folder) in the server directory
					and install the <a
						href="https://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/devtools.515/">DevTools</a> plugin.<br>
					For our first plugin, we are going to call it <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>. Now, create a
					directory in
					the <code class="code">plugins</code> directory called <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>. So now
					we have <code class="code">/plugins/FirstPlugin</code>.
					For convenience, in the future we are going to call this path <code class="code">~</code>. E.g.
					<code class="code">~/plugin.yml</code>
					refers to <code class="code">/plugins/FirstPlugin/plugin.yml</code>.<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, it is time to create the very first file of our plugin. But it is not PHP code. It is a <em>YAML</em>
					file that describes your plugin, located at <code class="code">~/plugin.yml</code>.<br>
				</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">
					name: FirstPlugin
					author: PEMapModder
					version: 1.0.0
					api: 1.13.0
					main: FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin
				</code></pre>
				<p>Before you try to copy, please read my explanation for them, line by line.</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">name: FirstPlugin</code></pre>
				<p>This line, apparently, defines your plugin name. Replace <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code> with
					your plugin name, and you will see it showing up in the startup messages when the server starts.</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">author: PEMapModder</code></pre>
				<p>This line, apparent as well, tells the server who wrote this plugin. Of course, replace
					<code class="code">PEMapModder</code> with your own name. It can contain spaces. However, if you
					have
					more than one author, change <code class="code">author</code> to <code class="code">authors</code>
					and
					put down all the author names, separated by commas <code class="code">,</code>, and put square
					brackets
					<code class="code">[ ]</code> around them.</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">version: 1.0.0</code></pre>
				<p>This line defines the plugin's version. It is purely internal with no rules, and the server will not
					try to understand what you are trying to say in the version. Just type whatever you like here as
					long as
					users and yourself can understand it.</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">api: 1.13.0</code></pre>
				<p>
					<em>API</em> means "application program interface". It is basically the things from PocketMine that
					lets plugins interact with it. It is like how a microwave oven has buttons to let people adjust
					it.<br>
					This refers to the minimum API version your plugin supports. You can find the current API version

					The first number refers to a complete change in API (major version). The plugin and the server must
					have the same number here to be loaded.<br>
					The second number refers to additions in the API (minor version). The plugin must have the same or
					smaller number here to be loaded.<br>
					The third number refers to minor API changes (patches). Any numbers work here, but you should use
					the number you tested for.<br>
					All these information aside, what you have to know is, you&apos;d better use the number you see in
					your server's startup.
				</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">main: FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin</code></pre>
				<p>
					Here finally comes the part related to the plugin code.<br>
					Short and unclear explanation:<br>
					<span class="note">This is the <strong>fully-qualified name</strong> of your plugin's
						<strong>main class</strong></span>.<br>
					This obviously explains nothing to someone who doesn't know what a <strong>class</strong> is. Let's
					just go through step-by-step.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					In PHP (especially in PocketMine-related PHP), code is contained in units called "classes". You can
					think a class as a "file" (and it is indeed true that we would normally put only one class in one
					file).<br>
					And what's even more exciting, since we have files, we have directories (folders) that contain the
					files. They are called "namespaces". Actually, we normally put a PHP file with the proper filename
					in the proper directory according to their namespace and class name. I said "normally" because it
					<em>sometimes</em> works if you don't, but just forget it and assume that it doesn't.<br>
					Usually, just like you put similar files in the same directory, we put classes of the same plugin in
					the same namespace. We can also have "sub-namespaces" just like we have sub-directories,
					<em>but that isn't important; just forget about it</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					By convention, we use Pascal-case for class names. That is, we would
					<code class="code">WriteLikeThis</code> if we all write in Pascal-Case.<br>
					Note that you can only use alphabets, the 10 numbers (0-9) and the underscore (<code
						class="code">_</code>) in
					class names. Also, class names cannot start with numbers.<br>
					For namespaces, the same rule applies. However, to create "sub-namespaces", just like file paths
					in Windows, we separate two parts by a backslash <code class="code">\</code>.<br>
					Now, to get a <strong>fully-qualified name</strong> of the class, which is like the full file path
					on Windows, we use <code class="code">NamespaceName\ClassName</code>. In our example,
					<code class="code">FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin</code> is the fully-qualified name of the namespace
					<code class="code">FirstPlugin</code> and the class name also <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what is a class? We will get it discussed in the next chapter.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="tree" data-name="Chapter 2 - A useless plugin that works: Some code, but just copy">
			<p>
				I have already explained about the meaning of namespaces and classes in the previous chapter -
				namespaces are like directories, and classes are like files. But to what extent are they alike?<br>
				Files that contain PHP code (source code) are called "source files". In your plugin, source files should
				be located inside a directory called "sources root", which should be at <code class="code">~/src</code>.<br>
				A source file ends with <code class="code">.php</code>. In front of that, it is the fully-qualified name
				of the class inside the source file.<br>
				Now we have the fully-qualified name <code class="code">FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin</code>, we should create
				our source file at <code class="code">~/src/FirstPlugin/FirstPlugin.php</code>. Simple. What's not so
				simple that gave the magical power to plugins is the things inside the file.
			</p>
			<div class="tree" data-name="Dummy class">
				<p>Hold your breath and scroll through all these.</p>
				<div class="codeEmbed" data-src="../resources/dummy.php" data-language="php"></div>
				<p>
					<strong>STOP</strong>. Don't copy it into your file. Oh, did I say "just copy"? Forget that.
					Instead, try to understand it and write it yourself when you know what you are writing.
				</p>
				<div class="tree" data-name="<?php">
					<p>
						This line, <code class="code">&lt;?php</code>, seriously does nothing at all. It doesn't help
						you in any ways. It is only here to tell people that this is a PHP file.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sadly, the human race is the best species at finding trouble for themselves. We <em>must</em>
						put this line at the <em>very beginning</em> of <em>every</em> PHP file, and better on an
						independent line.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tree" data-name="The empty lines">
					<p>
						Yes. Honestly. These lines are purely decorative. You can add spaces and tabs and break code
						into new lines <em>literally anywhere</em> in your PHP file (but after the
						<code class="code">&lt;?php</code> line!), as long as they don't cut one word into two.
						(But it is not reasonable to change <code class="code">function</code> into
						<code class="code">fun ct ion</code>, is it?)
					</p>
					<p>
						Nevertheless, programmers have a general habit of talking things in terms of "lines", but when
						we talk about a "line" of code, we generally refer to a <em>statement</em>. I will explain more
						about what a statement is later.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tree" data-name="namespace">
					<p>
						This is pretty obvious. When discussing the <code class="code">main</code> attribute in our
						<code class="code">plugin.yml</code>, we have already mentioned that the namespace of this
						class is <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have to <em>declare</em> the namespace in every PHP file, unless it doesn't have a namespace
						(but this SHOULD NOT happen in a plugin!). As you can observe, the syntax to declare a namespace
						is:
					</p>
					<pre class="code codefence" data-language="php">namespace namespace_for_this_file;</pre>
					<p>
						<code class="code">namespace_for_this_file</code> should be the whole namespace, including the
						backslashes (<code class="code">\</code>) and the subnamespaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't forget the semicolon at the end. A rule for PHP is that all statements would end with
						<code class="code">;</code> (semicolons), unless they end with a <code class="code">{</code>,
						then enclose other lines of code, and finally a <code class="code">}</code>. (Of course, except
						<code class="code">&lt;?php</code>, which is not code at all)
					</p>
					<p>'
						Keep in mind that the namespace statement <strong>must</strong> be the very first statement in
						every PHP file (of course after <code>&lt;?php</code>)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tree" data-name="`use` statements">
					<p>
						There are two types of <code class="code">use</code> statements:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="php">use Fully\Qualified\ClassName;</code></pre>
					<pre><code class="codefence"
					           data-language="php">use Fully\Qualified\ClassName as AnAlias;</code></pre>
					<p>Quite self-expanatory, isn't it? Actually, the first type is just a simplified form of the second
						type. We can change the first line into:</p>
					<pre><code class="codefence"
					           data-language="php">use Fully\Qualified\ClassName as ClassName;</code></pre>
					<p>They basically mean the same thing.</p>
					<p class="note">OK. But what are <code class="code">use</code> statements for?</p>
					<p>
						<code class="code">use</code> statements tells the <span class="hinted" title=
							"The part of the server that reads your code and turns it intosignals that it internally
							understands">PHP compiler</span> that when you later say
						<code class="code">AnAlias</code> in this file, you are talking about
						<code class="code">Fully\Qualified\ClassName</code>. In this way, even though the namespace is
						very long, we can <code class="code">use</code> the class as a short alias. If you don't say
						<code class=code">as</code> what, as in the first type, the PHP compiler will use the
						<em>simple class name</em> as the alias. In fact, programmers usually only use the first type to
						<span class="hinted" title="What is the sense of this?\n\nuse Space\Foo as Bar;\nuse Space\Bar as
						Foo;">avoid confusion</span>, unless they are coding something real quickly and short and use
						aliases to <span class="hinted" title="use pocketmine\utils\TextFormat as TF;">shorten the class
						name</span> (but don't do this in code where you expect other people to read, or yourself to
						read after a few months - people will have a hard time understanding it).
					</p>
					<p>In the dummy class above, we used:</p>
					<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="php">use pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase;</code></pre>
					<p>
						On line 7, we mentioned <code class="code">PluginBase</code>, but because of the
						<code class="code">use</code> statement from line 5, it actually means
						<code class="code">pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase</code> rather than merely
						<code class="code">PluginBase</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember that <code class="code">use</code> statements must be directly after the
						<code class="code">namespace</code> statement.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						Pro tip: apart from class names, use statements can also register aliases for namespaces. This
						is handy when you are using a lot of classes from that namespace.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						For convenience, I am going to refer <code class="code">use</code> statements as "<span
							class="hinted" title="Its counterpart in Java is 'import'">imports</span>" in the future.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tree" data-name="Class declaration">
					<p>
						Now, we have finally come to the most important part of our code. (Actually, the only part that
						does something meaningful).
					</p>
					<p>
						Before I start explaining what this line (line 7) does, let's have an overview on the syntax of
						the PHP language. Yes, an overview, a very brief and general one. Really general one, you'd
						probably think that this is useless, but it lets you automatically understand a lot of things
						in the future.
					</p>
					<p>Let's look at this text. Don't worry, it is written in English :)</p>
					<p class="note">
						When a player moves, if he is not an op, teleport him to jail. Take money from him. Send him a
						message. When the server stops, if the server owner is not online, notify him. Delete all
						worlds.
					</p>
					<p>
						This describes what happens in the plugin in English. I hope that you notice the <span
							class="hinted" title="The meaning of the text can be misunderstood as something different">
						ambiguity</span> in this text<br>
						I said "Take money from him.", but does this mean take money from him if he is not an op? Or
						whenever he moves?<br>
						"Delete all worlds.", does this happen only if the server owner is not online, or whenever the
						server stops?<br>
						To clarify my meaning, let's format my text into this:
					</p>
					<pre class="tree no-index note" data-name="Formatted text" style="font-family: inherit;">
When a player moves:
{
	If the player is an op:
	{
		Teleport him to jail.
		Take money from him.
	}
	Send him a message.
}
When the server stops:
{
	If the server owner is not online:
	{
		Notify him.
	}
	Delete all worlds.
}
					</pre>
					<p>Now, it is crystal clear that I am referring to the things inside the curly braces (<code
							class="code">{}</code>) when I say "if the player is an op". And as a matter of fact,
						this is how PHP understands what you say.
					</p>
					<div class="tree" data-name="Statements and statement groups">
						<p>
							In the PHP syntax, it main consists of two compoenents - <em>statements</em> and <em>statement
							groups</em>.<br></p>
						<p>
							A statement is like a sentence saying what to do, like "Teleport him to jail". Just like how
							we end every sentence in English with a full stop <code class="code">.</code>, we end every
							PHP statement with a semicolon <code class="code">;</code>.
						</p>
						<p>
							A statement group consists of a line that explains what this statement group is about, then
							followed by a group of statements. For example, in the text above, "When the server stops"
							explains what the following group of statements is about.<br>
							Yes, a statement group is a statement too. Therefore, we can have a statement group inside a
							statement group.<br>
							Usually, a statement group looks like this:
						</p>
						<pre class="codefence" data-language="php">
group_type{
	many statements;
	and nested statement groups{
		here;
	}
}
						</pre>
						<p>
							Sometimes, <code class="code">group_type</code> can contain more information than merely the
							group type. Let's go back to our dummy class for an example.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>This was our <code class="code">class</code> statement group:</p>
					<pre class="codefence" data-language="php">
class FirstPlugin extends PluginBase{
	# some code was here
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						This <em>declares</em> a <em>class</em> called <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>. we have
						previously decided that our fully-qualified class name should be <code
							class="code">FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin</code>, where the first <code
							class="code">FirstPlugin</code> is the namespace and the second <code
							class="code">FirstPlugin</code>
						is the simple class name. We have already declared the namespace for this file on line 3, so we
						don't need to mention it again.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next part of this line says that the class <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>
						<em>extends</em> <code class="code">PluginBase</code>. What does that mean?<br>
						Remember what we did on line 5? <code class="code">PluginBase</code> actually means
						<code class="code">pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase</code>, which is a class provided by PocketMine
						itself.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						So what? What does this class do? What is meant by <code class="code">extends</code>?
					</p>
					<p>
						The concept of "extend" is more complicated. But for the moment, you can assume that it means
						that this class is the main class of a plugin.</p>
					<p>
						There are two types of statements inside a class. They are <em>class properties</em> and
						<em>functions</em>. Class properties are the "memory" of a class, but you can ignore that for
						the moment. We are going to talk about functions first.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tree" data-name="Function declaration">
					<p>
						<code class="code">function</code> is another kind of statement group. It declares a
						<em>function</em>.
					</p>
					<div class="tree" data-name="What is a function?">
						<p>Have you ever learnt functions from mathematics? OK, if you haven't, learn it now.</p>
						<p>
							A function is like a crafting table. You add ingredients (<em>parameters/arguments</em>)
							into it, and it will give you some product (<em>return value</em>). Furthermore, the
							<em>order</em> of how you put the input matters.<br>
							For example, you have three diamonds and two sticks. If you put the three diamonds on the
							top, you get a diamond pickaxe. But if you put one diamond on the side of the middle, you
							get a diamond axe.<br>
							The same thing goes to functions. A function accepts some arguments (sometimes none,
							though). It expects each argument to be something. For example, a function that sets a block
							in a world would accept two arguments, the first argument being the position to change, and
							the second argument being the type of block to change into.<br>
							Functions are also like commands. Say, the <code class="code">/effect</code> command. You
							have to provide a player in the first argument. The second argument is the effect type. You
							can optionally also provide the third and fourth argument for duration and amplitude, but
							the command will assume default values for you if you didn't provide them.<br>
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Just like commands, apart from arguments and return values, a function also has a <em>name</em>,
						<em>description</em> and <em>permission</em>, although we instead call description
						<em>documentation</em> and permission <em>visibility</em>.<br>
						The function's <strong>name</strong> has the same rules as classes, except that it starts with a
						small letter
						instead of a capital letter. That is, we use <code class="code">camelCase</code> rather than
						<code class="code">PascalCase</code>.<br>
						There are three types of <strong>visibility</strong> for a function, namely <em>public</em>,
						<em>protected</em> and <em>private</em>. Public functions can be used from <span
							class="hinted" title="Don't underestimate it! You'll find out that this is literally
							anywhere, any plugins, anyone, any code on the server!">anywhere</span>. Private functions
						can only be used when you are writing code from that class. As for protected functions, they are
						like private functions, but also accessible by <em>subclasses</em>. What are subclasses? You
						won't need to know that until you are making really complicated or high-quality plugins (e.g.
						SimpleAuth).<br>
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						<span class="hinted" title="Actually, in PocketMine plugins all functions should
						be inside classes!">When a function is inside a class</span>, we also call it a "class method".
						But let's call it "function" to avoid confusion.
					</p>
					<p>As you may have already noticed, this is the syntax of declaring a function:</p>
					<pre class="codefence" data-language="php">
						<em>function_visibility</em> function <em>function_name</em>(<em>arguments</em>){
							<em>code_inside_the_function</em>
						}
					</pre>
					<p>For instance:</p>
					<pre class="codefence" data-language="php">
						public function myFunction($arg1, $arg2){
							// some code here
						}
					</pre>
					<p>
						You might be asking what the <code class="code">//</code> means. It is the <em>line comment
						symbol</em>. This means that everything on that line after the <code class="code">//</code> will
						be ignored. This is useful when you want other people, or yourself a few months (or a few days)
						later to easily understand what you are writing.
